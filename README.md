# Initiation-to-pytorch-Breast-cancer-classification

In this project, we will a neural network using pytorch from scratch. 
The goal is to predict if a patient based on several parameters has a breast cancer or not.
The dataset used contain 569 observations and 32 columns.

After applying data preprocessing like cleaning and standarisation, we designed 4 models with differents number of hidden layers and neurons.

The best model which give an accuracy of 99.12% was obtained using a deep network.

You will find find the notebook and the dataset used in this repository.
